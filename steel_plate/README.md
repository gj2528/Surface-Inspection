# steel_plate

In this I have implemented a basic KNN algorithm to classify 6 surface defects of steel plate. This achieves accuracy of 75.27% which i will try to improve in my machine learning capstone project.
The Dataset can be found at http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yunhyan/NEU_surface_defect_database.html
